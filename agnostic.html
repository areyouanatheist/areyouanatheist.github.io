              You didn't click "yes", so you're not a theist, right? So you do not or cannot affirm a positive belief in god(s)? The word we use to describe this (someone who is not a theist) is <strong>a</strong>theist.
            </p>
            <p class="accordion-p">
              There's a common misperception that being an atheist means you say "no god(s) exist", while an agnostic is some middlegrounder* who says "I don't know either way". But the truth is, these labels exist in different categories and are in no way mutually exclusive. Most atheists you meet are also agnostic (and vice versa) because they don't affirm theism as a <strong>belief</strong>, yet don't claim to <strong>know</strong> that no god(s) exist.

            <p class="p-footnote">**There is no middleground between "I believe in god(s)" and "I do not believe in god(s)". Conversely, there's no middleground between "I know god(s) exist" and "I do not know god(s) exist". So I would contend that the middleground agnostics
              are just very confused agnostic atheists.</p>

              I'm just telling you what's <i>technically</i> the case (should you accept the word usages described).
            </p>
            <p class="accordion-p">
              I can certainly understand why some people don't want or aren't ready to call themselves an atheist — it's a big step to take. It's also the case (sadly) that there's a number of places where "atheist" is a charged word that evokes all sorts of negative
              stereotypes and unfounded assumptions. It can also cause upset among religious family members/friends/employers/etc. The rule of thumb is not to tell people you're an atheist unless you're prepared to deal with the worst possible outcome
              it could have.

              I'm not a prescriptivist who thinks a word should have meaning by authority, but will argue (vociferously so)* that no other usages make sense.
            </p>

            <p class="accordion-p">
              You might have heard that atheists claim "there are no god(s)", but the logical counterposition to "I believe in god(s)" is "I do <strong>not</strong> believe in god(s)" — not "I believe no gods exist". These two statements sound the same,
              but there's a very important difference, which I'll demonstrate with a quick thought experiment:
              <hr>
              <span class="thought-experiments">
              Your friend tells you there is an even number of blades of grass in a large nearby field — <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/A_large_field_west_of_Hatchlands_Farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1256413.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a>.
              You wouldn't believe him, would you? But not believing him doesn't necessarily mean that you believe the number of blades of grass is odd. So the analogy goes: we do not believe in god(s) (we do not believe in an even number of blades of grass), but do not necessarily believe
              no god(s) exist (do not necessarily believe in an odd number of blades of grass either) — we'd need evidence to support either position. There are, however, some — a minority — of us who do make the extra step (who not only disbelieve in an even number
              of blades, but believe in an odd number), but it would be unfair/fallacious to conflate this subset of atheists with the superset.</p>

                  <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wwww.reddit.com/u/Nebulousweb">u/Nebulousweb</a> makes the excellent point that "odd" and "even" used in the analogy are both equal and reasonable, whereas the theist assertion is that there is something incredulous about the grass. For instance, they claim to know almost on faith alone that there are exactly 31,415,927 blades of grass, and this number matches the digits of PI because an intelligence made it that way.</li>

              You didn't click "yes", so you're not a theist, right? So you do not or cannot affirm a positive belief in god(s)? The word we use to describe this (someone who is not a theist) is <strong>a</strong>theist.

              If you're an ignostic/igtheist and think the concept of a god is meaningless, then of course you cannot affirm theism, so you're not a theist, i.e. you're an <strong>a</strong>theist.

              This resource exists to determine the philosophical position that is technically the case for you (should you accept the word usages described).

              I can certainly understand why some people don't want or aren't ready to call themselves an atheist — it's a big step to take. It's also the case (sadly) that there's a number of places where "atheist" is a charged word that evokes all sorts of negative
              stereotypes and unfounded assumptions. It can also cause upset among religious family members/friends/employers/etc. The rule of thumb is not to tell people you're an atheist unless you're prepared to deal with the worst possible outcome
              it could have.

              I'm not a prescriptivist who thinks a word should have meaning by authority, but will argue (vociferously so)* that no other usages make sense.

              It's okay to change your mind. What's important is that you've taken time to reflect on your position.
